# Learnings
* I became proficient in reading the code of our team members & merging them with other codes manually.

* I learnt how to collaborate & work in a team & the importance of assigning proper roles to each member.

* I also learnt how to deal with stressful situations like when your code is looking alright to you but isnâ€™t working.

* I learnt the importance of having a good mentor. Our Instructional Associates were very much helpful to us. They helped us whenever we asked them for help.

* My skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.

* I also learned how to plan project and execution.
